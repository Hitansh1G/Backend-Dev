The data (sometimes called “body” or “message”) contains information you want to be sent to the server. This option is only used with POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests.

To send data through cURL, you can use the -d or --data option:

curl -X POST <URL> -d property1=value1


To send multiple data fields, you can create multiple -d options:

curl -X POST <URL> -d property1=value1 -d property2=value2


If it makes sense, you can break your request into multiple lines \ to make it easier to read:

curl -X POST <URL> \
  -d property1=value1 \
  -d property2=value2
