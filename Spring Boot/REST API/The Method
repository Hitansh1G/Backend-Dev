The method is the type of request you send to the server. You can choose from these five types below:

GET
POST
PUT
PATCH
DELETE

These methods provide meaning for the request you’re making. They are used to perform four possible actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD).

Method Name	Request Meaning
`GET`	This request is used to get a resource from a server. If you perform a `GET` request, the server looks for the data you requested and sends it back to you. In other words, a `GET` request performs a `READ` operation. This is the default request method.

`POST`	This request is used to create a new resource on a server. If you perform a `POST` request, the server creates a new entry in the database and tells you whether the creation is successful. In other words, a `POST` request performs an `CREATE` operation.

`PUT` and `PATCH`	These two requests are used to update a resource on a server. If you perform a `PUT` or `PATCH` request, the server updates an entry in the database and tells you whether the update is successful. In other words, a `PUT` or `PATCH` request performs an `UPDATE` operation.
`DELETE`	This request is used to delete a resource from a server. If you perform a `DELETE` request, the server deletes an entry in the database and tells you whether the deletion is successful. In other words, a `DELETE` request performs a `DELETE` operation.

The API lets you know what request method to use each request. For example, to get a list of a user’s repositories, you need a GET request:

GET /users/:username/repos

A GET request is required to get a list of repositories from a user. To create a new Github repository, you need a POST request:

POST /user/repos


You can set the request method in cURL by writing -X or --request, followed by the request method. This command below tries to create a repository via cURL:

curl -X POST https://api.github.com/user/repos

Try running this request. You’ll get a response that tells you that authentication is required. (More on authentication later).
