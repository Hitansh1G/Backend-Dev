Developers update their APIs from time to time. Sometimes, the API can change so much that the developer decides to upgrade their API to another version. If this happens, and your application breaks, it’s usually because you’ve written code for an older API, but your request points to the newer API.

You can request for a specific API version in two ways. Which way you choose depends on how the API is written.

These two ways are:

Directly in the endpoint
In a request header
Twitter, for example, uses the first method. At the time of writing, Twitter’s API is at version 1.1, which is evident through its endpoint:

https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/settings.json
Copy
Github, on the other hand, uses the second method. At the time of writing, Github’s API is at version 3, and you can specify the version with an Accept header:

curl https://api.github.com -H Accept:application/vnd.github.v3+json
