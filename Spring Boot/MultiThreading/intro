to create a thread 
Thread t1= new thread();
this is the project of thread

now this thread is responsible to covert the array 

but the thread doesnt know wht to do 
so you will have to make a class 

class mythread
{
    int[]values = {6,5,1,7,8};
    public void run(){
        for(int i=0 ; i<5 ; i++){
            values[i]=values[i]*2;
        }
    }
}


but to achieve the true power of threads you can not make a simple thread , your class should be a thread 

Thread t1 = new mythread();
t1.run();


class mythread extends Thread
{
    int[]values = {6,5,1,7,8};
    public void run(){
        for(int i=0 ; i<5 ; i++){
            values[i]=values[i]*2;
        }
    }
}
so we have a main thread here , but parallaly if i want to start a new thread you have to sat start
run will not create a new thread for you you will have to say start method 
thread has multiple methods , you can call a method called sleep 
sleep - you are runniung a thread and you want to wait for 2 sec or 3 sec or more or less 
weight-
stop-
etc

if a class is already extended by another class we cant use extend Thread 

class A{
    
}
class mythread extends A implements Runnable
{
    int[]values = {6,5,1,7,8};
    public void run(){
        for(int i=0 ; i<5 ; i++){
            values[i]=values[i]*2;
        }
    }
}
