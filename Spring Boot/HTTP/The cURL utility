cURL is like a web-browser, but for the command line.You can make HTTP requests using cURL just like in a web-browser. The Response can be seen on the command line or redirected to a file.

Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands. Take your time and observe the output of each step closely.
Type the following curl command:
curl -X GET https://www.flipkart.com -o ~/flipkart.html
The output of the curl command goes to a file called flipkart.html. You can type  more ~/flipkart.html or cat ~/flipkart.html to see the contents of flipkart.html file.
In the above curl request, -X allows you to specify the HTTP method to be  used.
You donâ€™t have to use the -X GET switch => it is the default behaviour. Try the following command:


curl https://www.flipkart.com
curl can give you the same details that you were looking at, in the Chrome Developer Tools.

Try the below exercises and inspect the content of the flipkart.html file
curl -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html
You should see the 301 Moved Permanently reponse; just like in Chrome Developer Tools
We can also print the HTTP Response Headers using this:
curl -i -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html
Now, you should see the full Response Headers as well.
If you also want the full details, try the following command:
curl -v -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html
A verbose log is printed. You can get the IP Address and the port number from the console output this time.
You can also instruct curl to follow the Redirect uRL automatically using the -L switch


curl -v -L -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html    # still using http and not https

Can you find out other capabilities of cURL?
