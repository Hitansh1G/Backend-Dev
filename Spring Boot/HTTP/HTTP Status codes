What are HTTP Status Codes?
HTTP Status codes are part of the HTTP Response. It helps the client understand what happened to the request.
Status codes are 3 digit numbers (201, 304 etc) and are categorised to 5 different families based on their starting digit.
Along with the status code, a Reason-Phrase is also present (OK, Moved Permanently etc) which gives a short description of the status code.
The Status Code is intended for machines whereas Reason-Phrase is for humans.
