Build tools like Maven use a pattern to decide if a class is a test classes or not. The following is the list of classes Maven considers automatically during its build:

**/Test*.java           
**/*Test.java           
**/*Tests.java          
**/*TestCase.java   
    
includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that start with Test.
includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with Test.
includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with Tests.
includes all of its subdirectories and all Java filenames that end with TestCase.
Therefore, it is common practice to use the Test or Tests suffix at the end of test classes names
