A JUnit test is a method contained in a class which is only used for testing. This is called a Test class. To mark a method as a test method, annotate it with the @Test annotation. This method executes the code under test.

The following code defines a minimal test class with one minimal test method.



package com.vogella.junit.first;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class AClassWithOneJUnitTest {

    @Test
    void demoTestMethod() {
        assertTrue(true);
    }
}


You can use assert methods, provided by JUnit or another assert framework, to check an expected result versus the actual result. Such statement are called asserts or assert statements.

Assert statements typically allow to define messages which are shown if the test fails. You should provide here meaningful messages to make it easier for the user to identify and fix the problem. This is especially true if someone looks at the problem, who did not write the code under test or the test code.
