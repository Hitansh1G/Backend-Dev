JUnit 5 allows to use static imports for its assertStatements to make the test code short and easy to read. Static imports are a Java feature that allows fields and methods defined in a class as public static to be used without specifying the class in which the field is defined.

JUnit assert statements are typically defined as public static to allow the developer to write short test statements. The following snippet demonstrates an assert statement with and without static imports.

// without static imports you have to write the following statement
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
// more code
Assert.assertEquals("10 x 5 must be 50", 50, tester.multiply(10, 5));


// alternatively define assertEquals as static import
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
// more code
// use assertEquals directly because of the static import
assertEquals(calculator.multiply(4,5), 20, "Regular multiplication should work");
