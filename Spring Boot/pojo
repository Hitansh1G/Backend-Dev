POJO in Java stands for Plain Old Java Object. It is an ordinary object, which is not bound by any special restriction. The POJO file does not require any special classpath. It increases the readability & re-usability of a Java program.

POJOs are now widely accepted due to their easy maintenance. They are easy to read and write. A POJO class does not have any naming convention for properties and methods. It is not tied to any Java Framework; any Java Program can use it.
