/*
in very simple terms , module is a library or a set of reusable function , lets say there is a file which contains the operations of a calculator and there is another file which leads to access indivisual operations as and when required and when the code base increases i want to chuck out the reusable function and put it somewehre else so that it remains clean

now this becomes a module
